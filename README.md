# HallgrimJSScripts
This project contains the JavaScript parts of HallgrimJS JavaScript tasks which are not task-specific and which often interface with ILIAS including a script to check the used Version of ILIAS and import the rest. It exists to allow for tasks to be updated at later points, at least as far as the ILIAS-compatibility is concerned.

They are imported to HallgrimJS tasks via the use of jsDelivr.
